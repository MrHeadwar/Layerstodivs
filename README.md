# Layerstodivs

## Description

Gimp plugin to create html divs from gimp layers

Based on Lars Pontoppidan's Export Layers (https://github.com/Larpon/gimp-plug-ins)

This plugin for Gimp is used to export each folder to its own image file, and generate a HTML file 
containing Divs based on the position of the layers. It recreates the image with div blocks.

Optionaly, some custom CSS can be applied to the divs, and to the *:hover* state of the divs.

If a layer is named anything*@an_url*, i.e. includes an "@" followed by some url, a link to this url will be auto generated.
